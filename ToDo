== CogBase Truths
- 

- CogMind is a utility that takes input:
  - CogBase location
  - CogBase query
- Really we can fake the input with a YAML file
- and produces output:
  - a .mm Mindmap

- Create a very simple MM in FM
- Create a CogBase by hand
  - Take notes on design
- Write a test that generates the equivalent MM from the CB using CM
